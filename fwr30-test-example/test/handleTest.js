/*
Run your tests using Mocha:
bash
Copy code
npx mocha test.js
This will execute the test cases defined in your test.js file and provide feedback on whether your Lambda function behaves as expected.

Remember to replace './path-to-your-lambda-function' with the actual path to your Lambda function file.

This is a basic example to get you started. You can customize and expand your tests based on the specific behavior and requirements of your Lambda function.
